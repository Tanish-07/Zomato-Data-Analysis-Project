# Zomato DataScience/Analytics Project

This project focuses on analyzing Zomato’s restaurant dataset to extract meaningful insights about the food and restaurant industry. By performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques, we aim to identify key trends, customer preferences, and business opportunities in the food service industry. The project follows a structured approach to understanding data, uncovering patterns, and applying machine learning for predictive analytics.
